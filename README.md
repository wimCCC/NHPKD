# NHPKD
# Project Name

This project is built on the [MMrazor](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrazor) framework, aiming to provide efficient model distillation and compression methods, especially beneficial for tasks like infrared small target detection.

## Features

- Built on the MMrazor framework, supporting various state-of-the-art model compression and distillation methods.
- Provides efficient distillation strategies, particularly suitable for resource-constrained devices.
- Supports heterogeneous distillation, addressing the architecture mismatch issue present in traditional distillation methods.
- Code will be open-sourced soon, stay tuned!

## Installation

Please make sure you have installed the [MMrazor](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrazor) framework. For installation instructions, refer to the official MMrazor documentation.

```bash
pip install mmrazor
